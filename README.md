# Nursery-Cash-Flow-Management-App
A mobile application (created using Android Studio) to manage a nursery cash flow.

1. Project (quick) description
You have been asked to write a mobile application to manage a nursery cash flow. The nursery 
charges parents by hour and/or by blocks of hours. For example, they can charge AED40 per hour if 
a kid stays less than 4 hours. If the kid stays 4 hours, they can charge AED140. After 4 hours, each 
additional hour can be charged AED30. The nursery admin should be able to change this 
information.
The nursery also has expenses: rent, utility bills (DEWA, Etisalat…), human resources, etc. The 
admin should be able to customize the expenses to reflect the actual charges of the nursery.
The admin should be able to see the state of accounts, when the nursery can break even, monthly 
views, yearly views…
This application is for the nursery staff, NOT the parents.
Notes
• Project to be done in groups
• Each group should have 3 students
• If you reuse material from other sources (internet, books, papers…), you have to 
cite appropriate sources.
At a minimum, the application should allow the user to:
• Enroll a kid,
• Charge a kid,
• Give discounts,
• Enter expenditures,
• Generate statements for a specific kid (monthly, yearly, and custom dates),
• Generate statements for all kids (monthly, yearly, and custom dates), and
• Generate statements for the expenses vs. income for the nursery (monthly, yearly, and 
custom dates)
